libwebserver - a high performance embeddable webserver for C++ backends

What it can do?
* handle simple HTTP requests
* handle sync and async HTTP requests
* respond with small text/data packets
* perform time-dependent actions (like built-in cron)
* collect statistics on itself for monitoring purposes (traffic in/out, requests in/out, sustained/attained rates, latency, etc.)
* everything may be mixed according to our needs

Building libwebserver - External dependencies
* SCons
* TBB (Intel Threading Building Blocks)
* log4cpp

TODO
1. Simplify `helloworld`.
2. Write down a couple of examples of async request handling (ideas wanted).
3. Write or unhide comments/READMEs for libraries, included by dependencies (lib/* except `base` and `webserver`).
4. Cut unused code.
